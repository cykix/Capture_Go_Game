# Capture_Go_Game
# Objective:
The goal in Capture Go is simple: be the first to capture one or more of your opponent’s stones, depending on the agreed-upon number before the game starts (usually 1, 2, or 5 stones).
# Setup:
Board Size: Typically played on a 7×7 board (can also be 13×13 or 19×19).
Players: 2 players – one plays with black stones, the other with white.
Starting Player: Black goes first (as in regular Go).
# Basic Rules:
Placing Stones:
Players take turns placing one stone at a time on empty intersections.
Once placed, stones do not move (unless captured).
Capturing Stones:
Stones are captured by completely surrounding them on all four sides (orthogonal directions) with your stones.
A group of stones is captured only when all liberties (empty adjacent spaces) are taken.
Winning:
The game ends as soon as a player captures the required number of opponent stones.
# Why Capture Go?
It's an excellent introduction to Go for kids or beginners.
Teaches core concepts like liberties, capturing, and group formation without the complexity of full Go.
Quick and fun, with games lasting only a few minutes.
